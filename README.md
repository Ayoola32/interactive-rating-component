## Overview

A Frontend Mentor project that uses React to design an interactive rating component.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

In order to improve the UI, I used ReactJS to accomplish this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

working around using arrow functions

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

This is my first complete React project, I am looking forward to execute more project using React, along the way i am willing to learn and face more challenges.
Moreso, the uses of styling framework using bootstrap and tailwind, i need to refine on that as well.
